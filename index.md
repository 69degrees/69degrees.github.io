# About Us

Whether it’s the breaking news of the day, a text from your mom, or an overdraft alert for your piteous bank account, notifications can be stressful — or even downright crushing. But, be dreary no longer! 69degrees is here to notify you of a most delightful partnership between Mother Nature and Science.

With the 69degrees app, simply add a geographic location to your dashboard and start getting notifications whenever the temperature reaches 69&deg;F. Getting blasted by 69 notes (that’s a cool way of referring to notifications)? Simply toggle off and on the alerts!

**“But why 69&deg;F?” you may say.**

Well, I’m glad you asked. Let’s face it, the number 69 is hilarious! It was funny when your best friend Bobby first told you about it at the middle school lunch table and it was still funny when you were order #69 at the late night pizza shop last Friday. You chuckled when your dad asked you what the score was at that Knicks game four years ago and you pulled over to take a picture when the odometer in your car hit 6969 miles. Bryan Adams even wrote a song about it and so did Rick James (biiitch)!

So, when you get that first notification, remember to smile, whisper “nice” under your breath and know that despite all the troubles in the world, at least it’s 69&deg;F somewhere out there.
